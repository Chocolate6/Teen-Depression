<p>People that lose family members or a friend get into a deep depression, for teenagers this would be the most hardest time that teens will go through. They would lose interest in social life and lock themselves out. They would pretend that they are o.k so they wont let other know that they are really hurt.  </p>

<p>Moving to a new state is exciting but for a teen they will have to leave friends, break up with their girlfriend or boyfriend,its really hard to let memories of the people that you once knew go away. Going to a new school is the biggest problem of moving because they will have to make new friends and know other people. It will be hard to get comftorable but they have to get use to the change.</p>

 <a id="The Overall message." class="anchor" href="" aria-hidden="true"><span aria-hidden="true" class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a><h3>The Overall Message</h3>  
       
       <p> Being in depression can be hard to go through, many find it easy but depression is the most hardest time a teenager has to go through depression. Some people say that depression is not an emotion its more like a virus that people have to live with but it is very hard to get rid of.Teens feel isolated and left out becasue they suffer from this and having this can make someone life harder and sad. Depression can also effect adults. Most adults get depressed fro working too much or they feel alone, in conclusion depression can happen to anyone and it can have a negitive impact and hard to get rid of.</p> <a href="https://github.com/Chocolate6">Chocolate6</a> </section>
